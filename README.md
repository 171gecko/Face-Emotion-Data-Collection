# Face-Emotion-Data-Collection
This is just what I used to do as data collection for emotion recognition since image data is just so heavy and takes up space in my poor laptop.

So uhh, I think it was mediapipe facemesh or something so I used it to do data collection since images were just heavy and suck when data preprocessing and stuff so this is just better 
You could just run it maybe after installing some library stuff and your terminal wasnt that hard actually.

Just type:
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
pip install pandas

Theres this instruction too which appears at your terminal if you got in to run:
[INFO] Press keys to set label and '=' to save sample:
  Press 'A' for angry
  Press 'H' for happy
  Press 'S' for sad
  Press 'N' for neutral
  Press 'U' for surprise
  Press 'F' for fear
  Press 'D' for disgust
[INFO] Press '=' to save a sample with current label.
[INFO] Press ESC to exit.

Pls support me if you got some money to spare I'm just a broke guy thanks!
